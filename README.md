# HTML Generator

An application that generates HTML files using input from a Node.js command-line interface.

## Description

The project represents an application that allows users to take in information about employees on a software engineering team and generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Usage

- To generate a HTML file, open your terminal, run the command `node index.js` and answer the prompts.

- The user is then prompted to enter the **team manager**'s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.

- When a user enters those requirements, the user is presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer, add an intern or finish building the team.

- When a user selects the **engineer** option, the user is prompted to enter the following and then taken back to the menu: engineer's name, ID, email, and GitHub username.

- When a user selects the **intern** option, the user is prompted to enter the following and then taken back to the menu: intern’s name, ID, email, and school.
